            <h1 style="color:white;"> Context of the game</h1>
            <p style="color: white;">Our game known as "Pong V2" is a one player game and is<br>
            very simple to play. The directions are very simple as you just have to press<br>
            w to go up and s to do down. Also, you will have to reach 9 in order to win <br>
            the game. Our scoring system is if you can score against the bot. In order to <br>
            to do that you need to hit the ball past the paddle. The use of randomness of <br>
            in our game is due to the speed of the ball and where is goes when touching the paddle.<br>
            The game becomes more difficult as the points increase. For example, when the score <br>
            reaches 5, the backround changes and the ball changes as well. Including the speed of <br>
            the ball. The game can end when the player or the bot reaches a score of 9.
            </p>
            
            <h1 style="color:white;">Reflection Piece</h1>
            <p style="color: white;">I created the game because I was a big ping pong fan.<br>
            The Inspiration was based off the game ping pong. The two seccessful parts of our game<br> 
            was the use of randomizer blocks and others. Two obstacles of our game was making the <br>
            scoring system and how to change the stage. If I had more time and resources, I would of<br>
            made the graphics better and the directions were rushed. An algorithm that contributes in <br>
            game is the one for the ball. It is because the ball does the most work. </p>
