            <h1 style="color:white;"> Context of the game</h1>
            <p style="color: white;">Our game known as "Pong V2" is a one player game and is<br>
            very simple to play. The directions are very simple as you just have to press<br>
            w to go up and s to do down. Also, you will have to reach 9 in order to win <br>
            the game. Our scoring system is if you can score against the bot. In order to <br>
            to do that you need to hit the ball past the paddle. The use of randomness of <br>
            in our game is due to the speed of the ball and where is goes when touching the paddle.<br>
            The game becomes more difficult as the points increase. For example, when the score <br>
            reaches 5, the backround changes and the ball changes as well. Including the speed of <br>
            the ball. The game can end when the player or the bot reaches a score of 9.

            <h1 style="color:white;">Reflection Piece</h1>
            <p style="color: white;">I created the game because I was a big ping pong fan.<br>
            The Inspiration was based off the game ping pong. The two seccessful parts of our game<br> 
            was the use of randomizer blocks and others. Two obstacles of our game was making the <br>
            scoring system and how to change the stage. If I had more time and resources, I would of<br>
            made the graphics better and the directions were rushed. An algorithm that contributes in <br>
            game is the one for the ball. It is because the ball does the most work. </p>

            <p style="color: white;">The Guest is presented with a intro of the school ending. The Guest has to decide whether <br>
            to choose between Stiffy or Tekashi. If choosing Stiffy, they go to the pho festival and play games.<br>
            Afterwards, Stiffy meets Tekashi and his squad and beats Stiffy up. Blicky is amazed that Stiffy can stand<br>
            up to Tekashi and wants to marry him. Then the guest has to choose to if he wants to marry Blicky.<br>
            If he marries Blicky, then they will send Tekashi to jail and have a baby naming it Gibby. If they<br>
            don't marry then they go their seperate ways and have good lives. Going back to if the guest would<br>
            choose Tekashi then they would also go to the pho festival and play games. Then singing songs.<br>
            Afterwards, they go to Blicky's house and Tekashi become really disrespectful to Blicky's parents.<br>
            Blicky's parents dont approve of Tekashi and tells Blicky not to choose him. The guest could choose<br>
            not to follow the parents or to respect him. If they marry then Blicky will have lots of clout but,<br>
            if they don't Blicky goes to a good college and having a good life with Tekashi doing his own things.</p>

            <p style="color: white;">The iterative proccess of our story allowed the users to make decisions based off using elif statements.<br>
            We also used elif statements to check for errors and will not continue if the guest doesnt put the right values.<br>
            For the incremental part of our story, we orginised our scenes into functions because it allowed us to keep track<br>
            of everything we do and to not get lost. Some difficulties that I encountered was using the timer for the lines.<br> 
            This was kind of a big problem because sometimes the timer would mess up the decision making and other parts of<br>
            the story. They were resolved by refering to the teacher and going through the lines step by step. Another<br>
            problem was me not understanding all of the functions with python and this really made us struggle. One big<br>
            factor was with the while loops in the decsion making and that made us lose a lot of time. The advantages of<br>
            abstracting my scenes into functions was that it allows us to organize better. One story I read was about 3 Little Gremlings<br>
            and I enjoyed this because of the plot and the use of real life characters such as Nathon and Devin. I also liked<br>
            How they implemented real life with fiction to make one of the best stories in my perspective.</p>
