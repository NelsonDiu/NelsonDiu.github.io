 <h3 style="color: white;"> Biography: </h3>
 <p style="color: white;">
    My name is Nelson and I was given birth in the Fountain Valley Hospital<br>
    As a 4 year old child I loved playing games and was intrested on how it worked.<br>
    I've always as a little kid wanted to be mostly a gamer and forget everything about school.<br> 
    As I grew up, I learned that gaming could potentially destory your brain. <br>
    Both of my parents worked hard to get what I want and I am just a spoiled kid.<br>
    Life is pretty valuable and fun if you do<br>
    just be part of it and live it!
 </p>
 <h3 style="color: white;">Goals and Aspirations:</h3>
 <p style="color: white;">
 There are many goals that I want to accomplish before my death but it's possible to<br>
 try and accomplish most of this that I'd be satisfied.  My number one goal in life<br>
 (not emotionally) is to have a happy and fun family that I can spend my time with.<br>
 My other goals can be like being a pro gamer or a computer engineer and maybe a doctor<br>
 but it all takes time and commitment to become any one of them.What I want to accomplish before<br>
 I leave high school is to be proficient or advanced in almost all terms in computer like software<br>
 development,or website developer or making apps or even building more computers and one day have<br>
 my own company like Microsoft. What I can see myself when I turn 25 is studying and majoring in<br>
 the field of Computer Sciences and math-matics and maybe a girlfriend or wife. What I see myself when<br>
 I turn 40 is a happy family with a company like Microsoft where I can make my kids happy and live free.<br>
 In conclusion, I would like to live a happy life with loved ones around to make each other happy and a job<br>
 or company that can provide enough money for my family to enjoy their years in life and for their future!<br>
